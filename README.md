# 听雨 · Tingyu

A planner that runs in the browser: tasks, a pomodoro timer and habit tracking, in cozy pixel art.

**Live:** https://brguo55.github.io/006-tingyu-2026/

## Features

- **Tasks** — lists, a Today view, search, notes and due dates. Type 明天 / 周五 / 下周一 at the start or end of a task to set its due date.
- **Pomodoro** — focus, short and long breaks, linked to a task, daily and weekly stats, and an immersive full-screen mode. It stays accurate in a background tab and resumes after a reload.
- **轻重 (Eisenhower matrix)** — tag tasks 马上做 / 排时间 / 顺手做 / 放一放 (important × urgent). Add tasks inside a quadrant and drag them between quadrants.
- **Habits** — daily check-ins, current and best streaks, and a 22-week grid.
- **倒数 (countdowns)** — days until an exam, trip or deadline. Yearly ones (birthdays, anniversaries) repeat and show which year it is; past dates count up.
- **House** — a cozy pixel-art, Hollow Knight-style side-view map (1800 × 500 pixels, about 4 screens wide × 2 tall): a Chinese-style wooden home on an artificial asteroid, with red lacquer pillars, fret patterns, lanterns and curio shelves. Through a moon-gate window you see a domed courtyard in the rain and the star sea beyond. The camera follows **rabbit**, who rides a hovering golden chair (commissioned pixel art). A / D float left and right, Space jumps (hold for higher, with coyote time, jump buffering and a slight hang at the apex; press again in the air for a flame-boosted double jump), and S drops through furniture. E is reserved for interactions (none yet). While a pomodoro focus session runs he sips tea, and the hanging scroll in the tea room shows the live countdown. Areas: entrance, a double-height library with shelves to climb, the tea room, a study with a holo screen (it rains on it) and a real-time wall clock, plus a loft with a bed, reached by shelf steps. Parallax: the view outside moves slower and foreground pillars, vines and vases move faster. His bunny-eared bird flies along. Click him, finish a task, check a habit or end a pomodoro and he hops with hearts. There's a mute button (key M), and the color swatches tint the walls and rug.
- **Pixel UI** — the panel uses the [Fusion Pixel](https://github.com/TakWolf/fusion-pixel-font) font (SIL OFL 1.1, loaded from jsDelivr and cached for offline use), square 2px borders and hard shadows.
- **Offline & installable** — install it as an app from Chrome or Edge.

## Art

The scene is pixel art at 1 pixel = 2 world units, scaled up by whole numbers so pixels stay square. The house is drawn in code (`js/stage/house.js`). rabbit's animations are sprite strips in `assets/rabbit/`, one 80 × 112 frame per cell, converted from the artist's GIFs. They keep the owner's folder and file names, e.g. `00_basic/00_idle_rabbit_right` and `02_pomodoro/00_focus_rabbit_one`. They cover idle (left and right), a takeoff with a shockwave ring, a flame-boosted double jump, landing, and the tea-sipping focus loop. His design is asymmetric (robe on one side, mech on the other), so left and right are drawn separately rather than mirrored. A pixel-art brief for commissioning artwork is in [`docs/art-brief/`](docs/art-brief/README.md), with the new direction in [`docs/art-brief/concepts/`](docs/art-brief/concepts/README.md).

## Your data

Everything is stored locally in the browser (IndexedDB). Nothing is sent to a server or to GitHub.

Backups (Settings → 备份):

1. **Auto-backup to a folder** (Chrome / Edge) — pick a folder synced by Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox. The app writes `tingyu-latest.json` after every change, plus one dated snapshot per day, and keeps the last 30 days.
2. **Export / import** a backup file in any browser. Use this to move to a new computer.
3. The backup status is always visible, and you get a reminder if you haven't backed up for 3 days.

Never put the backup folder inside this repository — it is public. `tingyu-*.json` is git-ignored as a safety net.

## Development

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript: no dependencies and no build step. Serve the folder with any static server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

```
index.html, manifest.webmanifest, sw.js
css/          stage.css (canvas), app.css (panel)
js/stage/     map and controls (room.js), the pixel house (house.js), sprites (sprites.js, assets/rabbit/),
              pixel helpers (pixel.js), palette, canvas controls, audio
js/app/       util, store (IndexedDB), backup, tasks, pomodoro, habits, settings, app shell
